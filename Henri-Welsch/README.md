## 🎮 Project Overview

This Unity project is my submission for **Exercise 1**. The goal was to create a walkable **3D labyrinth**, lit using **ray tracing** to showcase realistic lighting effects including:

- Reflections
- Transparency
- Absorption
- Realistic shadows

The project features:
- A procedurally generated 3D labyrinth based on a 2D layout
- At least one **reflective**, **transparent**, and **absorbent** material
- In-scene light sources that emphasize ray-traced effects
- A first-person player controller for navigation

## 📚 Resources Used

To implement the project and better understand ray tracing in Unity, I followed these resources:

▶️ **[Unity Tutorial Series (Labyrinth)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwI90YLqMaY&list=PLZ1b66Z1KFKhO7R6Q588cdWxdnVxpPmA8)**  
▶️ **[Ray Tracing Overview for Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad9f_nKU0ZA)**

These tutorials helped guide the engine setup, rendering configuration, and ray tracing integration.

## 💬 Notes

- The project was built and tested using Unity’s High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) to support ray tracing.
- If you open the project in Unity, make sure ray tracing and DX12 support are enabled in your system and editor settings.
